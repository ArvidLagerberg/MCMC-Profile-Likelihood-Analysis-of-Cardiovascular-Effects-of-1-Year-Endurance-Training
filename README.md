# MCMC-Profile-Likelihood-Analysis-of-Cardiovascular-Effects-of-1-Year-Endurance-Training
This project focuses on the application of statistical techniques, namely Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and profile likelihood analysis, the original model was developed during my bachelor’s project titled “Modeling of VO2max during endurance exercise over different time scales​".
