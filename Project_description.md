# MCMC-Profile-Likelihood-Analysis-of-Cardiovascular-Effects-of-1-Year-Endurance-Training
This project focuses on the application of statistical techniques, namely Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling and profile likelihood analysis, the original model was developed during my bachelor’s project titled “Modeling of VO2max during endurance exercise over different time scales​".

Project aim: The aim of this project is to further investigate the model uncertainty and parameter behavior of the model developed in my bachelors project.
